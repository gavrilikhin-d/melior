# Emitting Basic MLIR

Simplest dialect, that doesnt add any operations:
```tablegen
// This include is necessary to use `Dialect`
include "mlir/IR/OpBase.td"

// Provide a definition of the 'toy' dialect in the ODS framework so that we
// can define our operations.
def Toy_Dialect : Dialect {
  let name = "toy";
}
```

Generate code for dialect:
```rust
// Generate rust code for the toy dialect.
melior::dialect! {
    name: "toy", // Name of the dialect. Should match `name` from tablegen file
    td_file: "examples/toy/src/include/toy.td", // Path starting from crate root (where `Cargo.toml` is located)
}
```
This will expand to:
```rust
/**`toy` dialect.*/
pub mod toy {}
```
Using `cargo expand` is always helpfull to figure out API generated by melior

Load dialects:
```rust
let registry = DialectRegistry::new();
register_all_dialects(&registry);

let context = Context::new();
context.append_dialect_registry(&registry);
context.load_all_available_dialects();
context.set_allow_unregistered_dialects(true);
```

Let's add our first operation:
```tablegen
// Base class for toy dialect operations. This operation inherits from the base
// `Op` class in OpBase.td, and provides:
//   * The parent dialect of the operation.
//   * The mnemonic for the operation, or the name without the dialect prefix.
//   * A list of traits for the operation.
class Toy_Op<string mnemonic, list<Trait> traits = []> :
    Op<Toy_Dialect, mnemonic, traits>;

def ConstantOp : Toy_Op<"constant"> {
  // Provide a summary and description for this operation. This can be used to
  // auto-generate documentation of the operations within our dialect.
  let summary = "constant";
  let description = [{
    Constant operation turns a literal into an SSA value. The data is attached
    to the operation as an attribute. For example:

    ```mlir
      %0 = toy.constant dense<[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]>
                        : tensor<2x3xf64>
    ```
  }];

  // The constant operation takes an attribute as the only input.
  let arguments = (ins F64ElementsAttr:$value);

  // The constant operation returns a single value of TensorType.
  let results = (outs F64Tensor);

  // Indicate that the operation has a custom parser and printer method.
  let hasCustomAssemblyFormat = 1;

  // Add custom build methods for the constant operation. These method populates
  // the `state` that MLIR uses to create operations, i.e. these are used when
  // using `builder.create<ConstantOp>(...)`.
  let builders = [
    // Build a constant with a given constant tensor value.
    OpBuilder<(ins "DenseElementsAttr":$value), [{
      build($_builder, $_state, value.getType(), value);
    }]>,

    // Build a constant with a given constant floating-point value.
    OpBuilder<(ins "double":$value)>
  ];

  // Indicate that additional verification for this operation is necessary.
  let hasVerifier = 1;
}
```

> In order to use builders you must use `ods-dialects` feature
